4. What are the steps you need to take to finish the project?
Ans: 
    Tentative Steps:
        1. Decide on the possible classes.
        2. Collect images (125 images per class).
        3. Annotate images.
        4. Decide and train a pre-trained model on the custom dataset. 
        5. Collect the model's performances when given 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% of the dataset.
        6. Prepare the paper and the presentation.

5. What are your plans for each week?
Ans: 
    Tentative Schedule:
        10/23 - 10/30   :   Do step 1, 2, and 3
        10/30 - 11/13   :   Do step 4 and 5
        11/13 - end     :   Do step 6
